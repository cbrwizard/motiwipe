# What
A motivation service to help you work on your projects.
Connect to Toggl, record your project time there. If it reaches your weekly goal - you’re good! If not - an amount you’ve set is taken from your card and is sent via Stripe to a charity organization of your choice. Slack off - and the charity organizations will take your money!

# Why
I found myself struggling to motivate me to do my side-projects after work. I’ve read that people are actually motivated by a loss more than a gain! You’re more afraid to lose 20$ than you’re happy to get the same amount.
This way an idea to create motiwipe.io appeared. You will work hard because otherwise you will lose money! Luckily, if you fail, at least the world will be better because of your donation and you won’t feel THAT bad [:

# Tech
Built with Node.js.
